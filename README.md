# Microbit_Soil_Data_Analysis

### This project serves as an introduction to fundamental electronics, programming, data analysis, and machine learning.

We have used keyestudio's "37 in 1 Starter Kit for BBC micro:bit". Check here and get the necessary parts first:
* 1x micro:bit
* 1x micro:bit Sensor Shield V2
* 1x Soil Humidity Sensor
* 1x Battery
* 1x USB to USB-C Cable

### When you import the .hex file to run on microbit, change the date and log frequency to your setting. After the logging, download the .txt file. After that download the Soil_Moisture_ML_Microbit.ipynb on the Software_Setup folder. Open the .ipynb file you just downloaded in Google Colab and follow the instructions to upload your .txt data to the Google Colab environment.
